# DiplomApp

# The functions of the application are to support the client's security systems (Viewing camera images, opening locks, access to services).

# Demonstrative code. It was created for a graduation project.

# Only for visual studio. It can be emulated on all versions of mobile devices.

# Demonstrates XML and C# language skills.

# A local database was created, as well as a direct link to demonstrate the work of the application on the diploma. This part of the code has been cut or commented out.

# Due to a lack of budget, access to remote servers and client support could not be implemented :)
